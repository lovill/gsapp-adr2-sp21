# ADR2 Grasshopper Example Files

This is a repository of example grasshopper files that showcase basic data visualization workflows.
See more details below.

All files follow these steps:
1. Import geometry
2. Create a dataset
3. Manipulate the geometry
4. Visualize the geometry

The files 01 to 04, use the same steps but with increasing complexity.
Follow along and post an image with custom datasets and geometries to your instructor's board.

#### Blocks Viz 01
Load one individual geometry for each individual dataset.

#### Blocks Viz 02
This file shows how to simplify the process leveraging the concept of *lists*.

#### Blocks Viz 03
Rather than listing custom and individual colors for each piece of geometry we can use color gradients to directly
represent something about the data that we are visualizing. In this case we are visualizing block height.

#### Blocks Viz 04
This file shows stacked gradient-colored blocks. By repeating the same process above the previously extruded geometries we can
visualize additional dimensions.
